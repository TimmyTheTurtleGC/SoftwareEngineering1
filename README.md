# Software Engineering 1 - Timmy the Turtle

This isn't a lesson in programming - that would be Software Engineering 101 and probably be located somewhere on campus assuming there's any space left on campus to hide anything. I'm throwing you straight into it. I've given you most the code, and you just need to complete one method.

There is no need to download this file to run it. You can run this code by copying and pasting everything into the demo section on http://www.skulpt.org/ or https://trinket.io/ (no registration needed to use the demo tools), and if all else fails, you can manually do everything with a pen, a protractor, and some graph paper, though you may find it a bit tedious.

This exercise requires you to write a caesar cipher in python. What's python? Python is a programming language - one of many such languages that attempt to make computers do what we want, but really anyone that's worked with computers long enough knows you can only hope they do what you want. You can read more here: https://www.python.org/ (which also has an place to run code in the browser, but can't run the turtle library used here).

Why python and not <insert some other language here>? 
To really meet the requirements to hide this cache, I can't force you to have to install software (though I can apparently make you shoot a rope 30 feet up a tree and force you to climb that for a smile - I didn't, don't worry), so I needed something I could point you to a couple websites and run everything in your browser. I also have to admit, I only have a passing familiarity with python as I'm a Java programmer, so every time you think to yourself "Why didn't he just do <x>?" that's why.


Please do not contact me about syntax errors or why your code doesn't run. Instead, I encourage you to follow the sage advice of one of my professors  (best read in a deep voice with a thick accent): "Google it."
